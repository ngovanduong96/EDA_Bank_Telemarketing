# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS IN BANK TELEMARKETING

This is a Python analysis of positive responses to direct bank calls for term deposits.

## Overview

The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (data importing, cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing) to uncover the attributes affecting clients' term deposit subscriptions. Through this analysis, we aim to answer questions such as:

* What are the demographic characteristics of the group of potential customers wishing to deposit money?
* Do housing loan and personal loan affect their decision to subscribe to a deposit term?
* How should customers be approached by call (duration, numbers of campaigns) to achieve effectiveness?
